The AUV uses a network interface, and accepts commands via a UDP port.  The AUV also broadcasts data via the same port.

The AUV will respond to commands in the format "type[.[name]]=value[;...]", where "type" is a type of command or variable to be set, "name" is the name of the command or variable to be set, and "value" is the data needed to set the command.

The AUV broadcasts data in a similar format, except that "type" and "name" describe the data being sent, and "value" hold the data.

== Commands ==
These are the Commands that the AUV will respond to.
* Connect.To=[IP address] - Tells the AUV to send data to the given ip address on the CLIENT_DATA_PORT
* Mode=[mode] - Sets the current AUV mode to mode.  Available modes are:
** Running
** Stopped
** Killed
** Reset
* Calibrate.Depth=[depth] - Tells the AUV what its actual depth is, it will attempt to use this data to calibrate the depth sensor.  The best use is to send a value of 0 when the AUV is at the surface.  Other values may give buggy results as of 3/11/10.
* Calibrate.WhiteBalance=auto - Re-white-balances the AUV's camera. (Untested)
* Param.[parameter]=[value] - Sets Brain parameter [parameter] to value [value]
* Input.[name]=[value] - Sets Brain input [name] to value [value]
* Flag.Rec=[true|false] - Enables/disables video recording
* Flag.Log=[true|false] - Enables/disables data logging (not implemented as of 3/11/10)
* GetParams=all - Triggers the AUV to send a datagram containing all of the Brain parameters

== Data ==
The AUV will periodically broadcast several packets containing data from different internal sources.  As of this writing those sources are:
* AUV - data describing the hardware state
* Brain - data describing the controlling software state
* Parameter - values of the parameters that control the Brain's functions

The specific data being sent is described below:
=== AUV ===
* AUV.Mode=[???] - a number representing something that needs to be documented better
* AUV.Heading=[number] - the AUV compass heading, in degrees from local magnetic north
* AUV.Depth=[number] - the depth sensor reading, in feet
* AUV.LeftThruster/RightThruster/LateralThruster/VerticalThruster=[integer] - the velocity of each thruster, range is from -127 to 127
* AUV.ThrusterVoltage=[number] - Voltage of thruster power supply
* AUV.ThrusterCurrent=[number] - Current through thruster power supply
* AUV.ManualOverrideDisabled=[true|false] - Whether or not the physical on/off switch is disabled
* AUV.CameraX=[???] - horizontal position of camera gimbal
* AUV.CameraY=[???] - Vertical position of camera gimbal

=== Brain ===
* Brain.State=[0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7] - enum representing the current state of the Brain state machine
* Brain.Time=[number] - Number of milliseconds used in each brain cycle.  This should not exceed the BRAIN_TIME_STEP config constant.  If it does, the brain will crash.

=== Parameter ===
The parameters are listed somewhere, and this feature does not work as of this writing.
