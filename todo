AUVC TODO list

Fix thrusters
	Switch vert and strafe thrusters
Fix depth sensor
Camera sunglasses
State enables
New parameters (Cam_Down_*)
JAUS
Compass calibration
Solder power to router in buoy
Replace drop servo
Retrieve drop marker
Paint drop markers
Attach hydrophones


Finish script sending

Partially tested - fix serialdevice.cpp and test
move drivers to serialdevice
thruster scaling calibration
integrate controlboard
separate auv.cpp into other classes
- scripting
- auvmotion (yaw, heave, surge, sway)
-- pid
-- thruster control
- you have pointers to the output devices, use them to have things work together! Don't forget the mutexes though.
New state machine
- States that start() model threads on entry, and quit() them on exit
- parallel states for vision processing?
Simulink model base class
- generated?
- model list (name, inputs, paramters, outputs)
-- generated from model files?
-- reflection?
-- c api?
- base class + generated derivatives/subclasses
- global set input, set parameter, and process output functions?
-- how to set parameter when model isn't running?
--- still have object, just not calling step_()
-- model hierarchy with all (e.g. path.input.centroid, path.param.hue, path.out.lookforthis, all.out.yaw, all.input.heading)
- Integrated or separate vision processing?
-- different steps (i.e. segmentation and blob analysis) in different models/threads?
